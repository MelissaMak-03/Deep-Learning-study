# Deep-Learning-study
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for my deep learning studies. It documents the lessons I've learned and showcases the mini projects I've undertaken to deepen my understanding of deep learning, a key subset of machine learning. Through this repository, I aim to share insights and practical applications of deep learning concepts.

## 1. Image classification
Classification is a method that focuses on predicting a class or a category of data. It is important to separate the data into a training and validation data to accurately predict the output. Training data are used to tell the model what to learn and the validation data are used to test our data.  Otherwise there might be a risk of overfitting meaning have a model that memorized the data set instead of learning from it and make prediction based on genralization.
