# Deep-Learning-study
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for my deep learning studies. It documents the lessons I've learned and showcases the mini projects I've undertaken to deepen my understanding of deep learning, a key subset of machine learning. Through this repository, I aim to share insights and practical applications of deep learning concepts.

## 1. Classification
Classification is a method that focuses on predicting a class or category of data. It is important to separate the data into training and validation sets to accurately predict the output. Training data are used to train the model, while validation data are used to test the model. Otherwise, there might be a risk of overfitting, which means having a model that memorizes the dataset instead of learning from it and making predictions based on generalization.
The purpose of this mini project is to test our classification model by evaluating its ability to recognize a country's currency based on images.
